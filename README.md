# Variable-Tracking-and-Schema-Capturing-to-make-Biomedical-Research-Data-FAIR-

# Our Goals
## Target: 
1. Extract schema from the data sets
2. Capture inventories of the files in the directories
  * Bagit and Pandas as potential tools
  * How many variables and missing values are in each file
## Stretch: 
Pulling data from CRFs and PDFs as structured data format 
	
To-do:
Exploring Bagit and Pandas to see if they are the appropriate tools to use
See if any tweekings of the scripts are need for our purpose
